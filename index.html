          <p class="horde-description"><strong>I started playing WoW when I was 8 years old, I didn't like the game at first but over time, it became my favourite game ever. Community and the environment of the game was just perfect.</strong></p>

          <p class="horde2-description"><strong>I started playing Rated PVP when I was 12 ish years old, which was at the start of Cataclysm. But only during Mists of Pandaria is when I actually got into Rated, I was able to reach 3200 as Destruction warlock and 2900 as Fire Mage and the rest is history.</strong></p>

            <p class="horde3-description"><strong>Mythic Plus was released in the expansion "Legion" during the patch "7.0.3", that's when I started and to be honest I was alright, not the best not the worst. But only in the Expansion "Battle for Azeroth" during the "8.3" patch is where I had fun pushing my rating in Mythic Plus. I was able to get rank 1 on my realm "Magheridon" as Arms Warrior.</strong></p>
